# Contracts

This directory is intended to hold API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI specifications, GraphQL schemas) related to the `003-project-readme` feature or the broader "Evolution of Todo" project.

The `003-project-readme` feature, being a documentation task, does not introduce new API contracts. This directory is created to adhere to the `/sp.plan` workflow's expectation of a `contracts/` artifact.
